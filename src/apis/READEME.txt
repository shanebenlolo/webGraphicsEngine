users.js is a dummy api that contains boilerplate and a styleguide for api calls.

/shapes will eventually move to a nodejs backend and be used to bring shapes into scenes as
requested by users. In the meantime it will live on the front end and be called to directly
until the amount of geometry being called is too large to keep on the front end.
